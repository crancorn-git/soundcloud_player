CranCloud Player — v0.3.0
Release date: 2025-11-26
Big Rebrand & Total Overhaul
We have completely rewritten the application's frontend using React & Vite. The app is now faster, smoother, and features a modern, professional interface inspired by "Cranotes". We have also officially renamed the project to CranCloud Player.
New Features
Zen Mode
Enter a distraction-free, full-screen experience with large artwork, a blurred backdrop, and essential controls. Perfect for second monitors.
Home Dashboard
Jump Back In: A grid of your recently liked tracks for instant access.
Recently Played: A history ribbon of tracks you've listened to in this session.
Quick Play: A widget to instantly search and play a specific song without leaving the home screen.
Up Next: A persistent view of your current queue.
Customizable Themes
Not a fan of Orange? You can now switch the app's accent color to Blue, Purple, Pink, Green, or Red via Settings.
Sleep Timer
Added a built-in sleep timer (15m, 30m) in the "More" menu to automatically pause playback.
Frameless UI
The native window title bar is gone. The app now features a seamless, custom title bar that blends perfectly with the dark theme.
Improvements
Collapsible Sidebar: Gain more screen real estate by collapsing the navigation bar.
Smart Search: The search page now guides you with prompts and handles empty states gracefully.
Volume Memory: The player now remembers your volume level between sessions and restores it correctly after unmuting.
Drag & Drop Seek: The progress bar is now fully draggable for smoother seeking.
Fixes
Looping Fixed: Resolved an issue where looping a single track would sometimes stop playback. It now reliably restarts the track.
Image Sizing: Fixed a layout bug where album art in the grid would stretch or squish when resizing the window.
Window Dragging: Fixed issues where the window couldn't be dragged or where clicks passed through the title bar.
Queue Logic: Fixed the "Queue Next" button logic to ensure tracks are added correctly to the current playlist context.
